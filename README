The purpose of this 'learning' repository consists of two reasons.
First, I am learning how to use github.
Second, I am learning C# as a hobby.

I am a windows systems admin by trade and I am taking uup C# to try and improve my efficiency while at work. I find myself doing repetitive tasks and it is driving me bonkers. Because of that, I am working on tools that can help. I also wouldn't mind learning MVC, Silverlight, .NET and C#. So far, I am very much interested, I just do not know how to get there. I can read technical books for the Windows server environment, but when it comes to programming books, they all seem to be written in a foreign language (in part because it is like learning a foreign language)!
