This is my first github upload.
It is a simple Microsoft C# remainder application. It just grabs the remainder of a divisor.
I am learning C# and github at the same time. This is just a personal endeavour.
By nature, I am a windows systems admin learning to code for fun and to create tools that will help improve my efficiency at work (so I can be lazy!).
